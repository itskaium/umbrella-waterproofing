                            There are some calls you’re probably used to handling: leaky faucet, clogged toilet, locked door…Then there are tenant calls that should raise the caution flag: black spots forming on the ceiling, soft/damp drywall, a water drip that can’t be identified. These are common signs that water is leaking within your building. Leaky pipes aren’t always to blame — often the roof, deck, walkway or plaza needs to be repaired, resurfaced and resealed to ensure proper rainwater runoff. <br><br>One call is all it takes to save your clients from the surprise costs of easily preventable water-damage repairs. Umbrella Waterproofing can perform annual inspections in between regularly scheduled professional waterproofing services.<br><br> Flat roofs, plazas and decks made of concrete, vinyl, non-slotted wood or other substrates should be professionally waterproofed (about every five years) to prevent leaks and structural corrosion.
